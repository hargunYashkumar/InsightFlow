- **Data Analytics**: Tools for clustering, classification, and regression using `caret`.
- **Data Management**: Robust integration with databases through `RSQLite`.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management with Google OAuth.
- **Customizable UI**: Enhanced UI components with `shinyWidgets` and `bslib`.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Reactive capabilities for instant feedback on user actions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Core Framework**: Shiny
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, plotly, heatmaply, treemap
- **Machine Learning**: caret
- **Database Integration**: RSQLite, DBI
- **Authentication**: googleAuthR
- **UI Components**: shinyWidgets, shinyjs, bslib
- **Loading Animations**: waiter

---

## üß© Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **R**: Ensure you have R installed ([Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)).
- **RStudio**: Recommended for managing Shiny applications.
- **Packages**: Install the required libraries. Use:
  ```R
  install.packages(c(
    "shiny", "DT", "ggplot2", "plotly", "heatmaply", "treemap",
    "caret", "dplyr", "httr", "tidyr", "RSQLite", "digest",
    "shinyjs", "bslib", "googleAuthR", "waiter", "shinyWidgets"
  ))

  
Thank you for providing the files. I'll analyze the data in your provided R scripts (global.R and server.R) and draft a professional README.md file for your GitHub repository.

Let me start by reviewing the contents of these files.

The files appear to be part of a Shiny application, leveraging R for creating an interactive web-based data analytics platform. Here's a breakdown of what I found so far:

global.R
This file contains:

Library imports: Includes libraries like shiny, ggplot2, plotly, caret, and RSQLite, suggesting data visualization, machine learning, and database integration.
Google OAuth: Configuration for user authentication using Google services.
Utility setup: It likely initializes settings and global variables required across the app.
server.R
This file contains:

Server logic: Defines the backend of the Shiny app, including:
User authentication (via Google OAuth and email validation).
Reactive handling of user input and dynamic updates.
Next Steps
Based on this preliminary analysis, I'll draft a detailed README.md file. It will include:

Overview of InsightFlow.
Features of the application.
Technologies used.
Setup instructions.
Usage details.
Let me prepare the draft. ‚Äã‚Äã
